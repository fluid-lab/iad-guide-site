This is an example of website created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - an open-source static site generator.

In this site you will see some example content from the draft IAD Guide to give you a sense of how content can be structured (see the section [The IAD Guide](./chapters/)). There is also some documentation describing how this site was created.
