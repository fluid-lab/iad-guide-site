This website is a demonstration of how Hugo can be used to create a static website. Hugo is very flexible and can be customized to fit your content and presentation.

## Getting Started

Hugo was downloaded and installed by following the [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) guide. The [Blank theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/blank/) was used as a starting point for a custom  `iad-guide-theme` theme. This theme can be found in the `/themes/` directory.

Giraffe Academy has a comprehensive, [free tutorials on how to use Hugo](http://www.giraffeacademy.com/static-site-generators/hugo/).

Smashing Magazine talks about a common hurdle in publishing content online and describes how Hugo was used to ease their workflow. See article ["Building Pattern Libraries With Shadow DOM In Markdown"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/pattern-libraries-in-markdown/) on Smashing Magazine.

## Added Features

[UI Options](https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/) was added to enable UI customizations. To add UI Options to a site, follow this guide: [Setting Up User Interface Options](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html).

[Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) was used to accelerate styling of this demo. From experience, Foundation offers decent accessibility, and works with the Infusion UI Options component. Whatever CSS frameworks chosen, it is recommended that the framework use `rem` or `em` units for sizing, otherwise UI Options may not work.

## Bugs and Feedback

Since this is demo, it's expected to be some quirks and bugs. Please give feedback and suggestions to [iad-guide-theme on Github](https://github.com/fluid-lab/iad-guide-theme/issues).
